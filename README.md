# Pages
Pages is an add-on that adds addiitonal pages to the Minecraft mod Mystcraft. The CurseForge page is located here: 
https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/pages

If you woukd like to contribute block ideas, the best way is to make a pull request for https://github.com/TheFloydman/Pages/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/pages/blocks.csv. Most columns are self-explanatory, but for the others: CardRank refers to the probability that a page will be found as loot, qnd CategoryRank refers to the probability that a oage will be selected by Mystcraft's grammar when it has to fill in some missing information. For example, if you include a "spikes" page in your Descriptive Book but don't place a valid block page before it, Mystcraft will choose a Structure page at random.
